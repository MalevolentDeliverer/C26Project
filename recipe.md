The first thing  to do is to prepare your chicken. Marinate and store in fridge for 24 hours. Then, when making the sandwich, cut the vegetables how you want them, preferably flat, grill the hamburger buns. To create the sandwich, start with your sauce, then a small amount of lettuce. Then add the tomato, piece of chicken and onion above it all. Finish with a little more sauce, and then a small amount of lettuce, and then the top hamburger bun. Now all is left to do is enjoy.
